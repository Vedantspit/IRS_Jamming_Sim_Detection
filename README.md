# 🛰️ IRS-Aided Attack Detection Framework for UAV-Assisted Networks in 5G and Beyond

This repository contains the source code, simulation setup, and model implementation for a secure UAV communication framework that integrates **Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces (IRS)** and a **CNN-LSTM deep learning model** for **real-time jamming detection** in 5G mmWave networks.

The framework is evaluated using **ns-3 simulations** under various jammer and user mobility scenarios.
